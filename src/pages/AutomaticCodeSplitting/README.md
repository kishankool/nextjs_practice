 Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller chunks, loading only the necessary JavaScript for each page. This helps to reduce initial page load times.


 Automatic code splitting is a feature in Next.js that improves the performance of your application by splitting your JavaScript code into smaller chunks and loading them only when needed. This optimization helps reduce the initial page load time and improves the overall user experience.

Here's how automatic code splitting works in Next.js:

Component-based splitting: Next.js automatically splits your code based on your React components. Each page in your Next.js application corresponds to a JavaScript file in the pages directory. When you navigate to a specific page, only the JavaScript code for that page and its dependencies are loaded initially.

Route-based splitting: Next.js also supports route-based code splitting. If you have dynamic routes or routes that require additional components or dependencies, Next.js will automatically split the code for those routes into separate chunks. This ensures that only the necessary code is loaded for each route, reducing the initial bundle size.

Optimized loading: Next.js uses techniques like prefetching and lazy loading to optimize the loading of code chunks. Prefetching allows Next.js to load code chunks for upcoming routes in the background, while lazy loading ensures that code chunks are loaded asynchronously when they're needed, such as when a user navigates to a new route.

Bundle analysis: Next.js provides tools for analyzing your bundle size and identifying opportunities for further optimization. You can use tools like next build and third-party plugins to analyze your bundle and identify code chunks that can be further split or optimized.

By automatically splitting your code into smaller chunks and loading them only when needed, Next.js improves the performance of your application and ensures a faster and smoother user experience, especially on slower networks or devices. Automatic code splitting is one of the key optimizations that Next.js provides out of the box to help you build fast and efficient web applications.



Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/PageA and http://localhost:3000/PageB. You'll see the content of each page rendered accordingly.
Next.js automatically splits the code for each page into separate chunks. When you navigate to PageA, only the code for PageA and its dependencies are loaded. Similarly, when you navigate to PageB, only the code for PageB and its dependencies are loaded. This ensures that each page is loaded quickly and efficiently, improving the overall performance of your Next.js application through automatic code splitting.
