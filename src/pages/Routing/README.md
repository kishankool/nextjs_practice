Next.js simplifies routing by allowing you to create dynamic routes easily. It follows a file-based routing system where each page corresponds to a file in the pages directory.


Routing is a crucial aspect of any web application as it defines how different URLs (or paths) map to different views or pages within the application. In Next.js, routing is handled automatically based on the file structure inside the pages directory.

Let's go through a basic example to understand how routing works in Next.js:

By default, Next.js uses a file-based routing system. Inside the pages directory, each JavaScript file represents a route in your application.

For example:

pages/index.js corresponds to the home page (route /)
pages/about.js corresponds to the about page (route /about)
pages/posts/[id].js corresponds to a dynamic route for displaying individual posts, where [id] is a parameter (route /posts/:id)
