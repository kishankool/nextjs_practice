Next.js supports generating static websites at build time, pre-rendering pages as static HTML files. This can lead to faster page loads as the content is served statically from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).


While the names "server-side rendering" (SSR) and "static site generation" (SSG) might sound similar, they refer to different approaches to rendering content in web applications.

Here's a breakdown of each:

Server-Side Rendering (SSR):

With SSR, the server renders the web page HTML dynamically for each request.
When a user visits a page, the server generates the HTML content, including any data fetched from databases or APIs, and sends it to the client's browser.
SSR is useful for delivering dynamic content that needs to be personalized or frequently updated.
SSR can improve SEO since search engine crawlers can easily index the fully-rendered HTML content.
Static Site Generation (SSG):

With SSG, the pages of a website are pre-rendered at build time, and the generated HTML files are served statically.
During the build process, Next.js generates HTML files for each page, including any data fetched at build time.
When a user visits a page, the server serves the pre-generated HTML file directly, without the need to render it dynamically.
SSG is suitable for content that doesn't change frequently, such as marketing pages, blogs, or documentation sites.
SSG can lead to faster page loads and better performance since there's no need to generate HTML dynamically on each request.
In summary, while both SSR and SSG involve rendering content on the server, they differ in when and how the content is generated:

SSR generates HTML dynamically for each request, whereas SSG pre-generates HTML at build time.
SSR is suitable for dynamic content, while SSG is ideal for static or semi-static content.
SSR can be more resource-intensive since it requires rendering content on each request, while SSG offers improved performance and scalability by serving pre-rendered static files.
