Next.js provides utilities and examples for implementing authentication and authorization in your applications, making it easier to secure your pages and API routes.


Certainly! While Next.js itself doesn't provide built-in authentication or authorization features, it offers a flexible architecture that allows you to integrate various authentication and authorization solutions. Let's see how you can implement authentication and authorization using Next.js with an example using NextAuth.js for authentication and role-based authorization.

First, you need to set up a Next.js project and configure NextAuth.js. You can follow the documentation on the NextAuth.js website for detailed instructions on setting up authentication.

Once you have NextAuth.js configured, you can implement role-based authorization using session data provided by NextAuth.js.

NextAuth.js handles user authentication using various providers (e.g., Google, GitHub).
Custom logic in the session callback adds user roles to the session data.
The ProtectedPage component checks the user's session to determine if they are authenticated and have the necessary roles to access the page.
If the user is not authenticated, they are redirected to the login page.
If the user is authenticated but does not have the required role, they are redirected to an unauthorized page.
This example demonstrates how you can implement authentication and role-based authorization in Next.js using NextAuth.js. You can customize the authentication flow and authorization logic to fit your application's requirements.
